We have a tree any tree type it could be binary.
Need to find the leave that is closest to the root. The distance is the shortest.structures.Tree is read-only.
Need to print the depth and the value.

For example in our case we have G or F that are the closest.
So print should be A-C-G or A-C-F (no need to support 2).
